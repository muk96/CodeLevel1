Problem : Implements a simple to-do list.
 The program should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display all incomplete tasks.


Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility.
The TodoList class is responsible for managing the tasks,
while the TodoListApp class is responsible for the command-line interface.

Open/Closed Principle: The TodoList class is open for extension (i.e., we can add new methods to manipulate the list),
 but closed for modification (i.e., we don't need to modify the existing methods to add new functionality).


Liskov Substitution Principle: The TodoList class follows the contracts of the methods defined in the TodoListInterface,
 and can be used interchangeably with other implementations of the interface.
